# Grid Map Navigator

<img src="documentation/png/ruutukartta.png" width="750">

The application is a grid map navigator, which finds the best route between two grid nodes.  Every grid node on the map has a value (1-9) representing the cost or time increment added when the route is passing the node.

Route finding can be tested with different algorithms; Dijkstra, A*, IDA* and Jump Point Search.

The route can pass from one grid node to its neighbour nodes either orthogonally or both orthogonally and diagonally.

The program is written in Python.
